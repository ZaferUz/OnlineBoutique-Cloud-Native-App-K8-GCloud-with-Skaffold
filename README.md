**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. It‚Äôs **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

> üëì**Note: We will deploy our application in 3 different ways ```kubernetes-manifests```, ```skaffold```** 

```./kubernetes-manifests```

 ```skaffold run  ```


Looking for the old Hipster Shop frontend interface? Use the [manifests](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/v0.1.5/kubernetes-manifests) in release [v0.1.5](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/releases/v0.1.5).

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Local Development

If you would like to contribute features or fixes to this app, see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md) on how to build this demo locally.

## Installation
- We offer the following installation methods:

  1. **Running locally** (~20 minutes) You will build and deploy microservices images to a single-node Kubernetes cluster running on your development machine. There are two options to run a Kubernetes cluster locally for this demo:

    - Minikube. Recommended for the Linux hosts (also supports Mac/Windows).
    - Docker for Desktop. Recommended for Mac/Windows.
  2. **Running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**‚Äù (~30 minutes) You will build, upload and deploy the container images to a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud.

  3. **Using pre-built container images:** (~10 minutes, you will still need to follow one of the steps above up until skaffold run command). With this option, you will use pre-built container images that are available publicly, instead of building them yourself, which takes a long time).

### Option 1: Running locally
üí° Recommended if you're planning to develop the application or giving it a try on your local cluster.

1. Install tools to run a Kubernetes cluster locally:

- kubectl (can be installed via gcloud components install kubectl)
- Local Kubernetes cluster deployment tool:
    -- Minikube (recommended for Linux).
    -- Docker for Desktop (recommended for Mac/Windows): It provides Kubernetes support as noted here.
- skaffold (ensure version ‚â•v0.20)
2. Launch the local Kubernetes cluster with one of the following tools:

- Launch Minikube (tested with Ubuntu Linux). Please, ensure that the local Kubernetes cluster has at least:

    -- 4 CPU's
    -- 4.0 GiB memory
    To run a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube using the described configuration, please run:
```
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory 4096
```
- Launch ‚ÄúDocker for Desktop‚Äù (tested with Mac/Windows). Go to Preferences:
    -- choose ‚ÄúEnable Kubernetes‚Äù,
    -- set CPUs to at least 3, and Memory to at least 6.0 GiB
    -- on the "Disk" tab, set at least 32 GB disk space
3. Run kubectl get nodes to verify you're connected to ‚ÄúKubernetes on Docker‚Äù.

4. Run skaffold run (first time will be slow, it can take ~20 minutes). This will build and deploy the application. If you need to rebuild the images automatically as you refactor the code, run skaffold dev command.

5. Run kubectl get pods to verify the Pods are ready and running. The application frontend should be available at http://localhost:80 on your machine.


## Running On Cloud

###  **Gcloud** is the command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell and supports tab-completion

# üí° **We will use 3 different deployment ways to run the app**

## Option 1: Deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine with Kubemanifest  

- You can list the active account name with this command:
```
gcloud auth list
```
- You can list and choose the projects:
```
gcloud config list project
```
- or you can create a Google Cloud Platform project.
- Set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Operations APIs are enabled.

```
# set the project Id 1:
PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
# or set the project Id 2:
# export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')

gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com \
    cloudtrace.googleapis.com \
    clouddebugger.googleapis.com \
    cloudprofiler.googleapis.com \
    --project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

- Set the zone in gcloud
```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b
# or choose one of them, you want.
```

- Create a GKE cluster.
```
ZONE=us-west1-b
gcloud container clusters create onlineboutique \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE} \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-2 --num-nodes=4
```

**Note:** Connect to Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and validate that it's been created correctly.
```
gcloud container clusters list
```

- Once your cluster has RUNNING status, get the cluster credentials:
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials shop-cluster --zone us-west1-b
```
- Verify that the nodes have been created:
```
kubectl get nodes
```

- Deploy the sample app to the cluster.
```
kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```
- Wait for the Pods to be ready.

```
kubectl get pods
```

- Sample output: 

```

```
- Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's EXTERNAL_IP.
```
kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
```
- Example output - do not copy
```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
Note- you may see <pending> while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.
```
- Clean up:
```
gcloud container clusters delete onlineboutique \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE}
```
## Option 2: Deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine with with Skaffold

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Kubernetes manifests provided in this directory are not directly deployable to a cluster. They are meant to be used with skaffold command to insert the correct image: tags. 

- You can list the active account name with this command:
```
gcloud auth list
```
- You can list and choose the projects:
```
gcloud config list project
```
- or you can create a Google Cloud Platform project.
- Set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Operations APIs are enabled.

```
# set the project Id 1:
PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
# or set the project Id 2:
# export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')

gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com \
    cloudtrace.googleapis.com \
    clouddebugger.googleapis.com \
    cloudprofiler.googleapis.com \
    --project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

- Set the zone in gcloud
```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-b
# or choose one of them, you want.
```

- Create a GKE cluster.
```
ZONE=us-west1-b
gcloud container clusters create onlineboutique \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE} \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-2 --num-nodes=4
```

**Note:** Connect to Google Kubernetes Engine cluster and validate that it's been created correctly.
```
gcloud container clusters list
```

- Once your cluster has RUNNING status, get the cluster credentials:
```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials shop-cluster --zone us-west1-b
```
- Verify that the nodes have been created:
```
kubectl get nodes
```



- Run the following to clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
```
- Create a soft link to your working directory:
```
ln -s ~/training-data-analyst/blogs/microservices-demo-1 ~/microservices-demo-1

```
- Download and install skaffold:
```
curl -Lo skaffold https://storage.googleapis.com/skaffold/releases/latest/skaffold-linux-amd64 && chmod +x skaffold && sudo mv skaffold /usr/local/bin
```
Install the app using skaffold:
```
cd microservices-demo-1
skaffold run
```
- Confirm everything is running correctly:
```
kubectl get pods
```

- Get the external IP of the application:
```
export EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get service frontend-external | awk 'BEGIN { cnt=0; } { cnt+=1; if (cnt > 1) print $4; }')
```


- Finally, confirm that the app is up and running:
```
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n"  http://$EXTERNAL_IP

# Your confirmation will look like this:200
```

- Download the source and put the code in the Cloud Source Repo: = **"cat setup_csr.sh"**
