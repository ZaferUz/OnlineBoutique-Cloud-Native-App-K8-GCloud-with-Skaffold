1. **Deploy the sample app to the cluster.**

```
kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

5. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```

```

7. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```
kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
```

**Note**- you may see `<pending>` while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.

8. [Optional] **Clean up**:

```
gcloud container clusters delete onlineboutique \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE}
```

## Other Deployment Options

- **Workload Identity**: [See these instructions.](docs/workload-identity.md)
- **Istio**: [See these instructions.](docs/service-mesh.md)
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: ASM requires Workload Identity to be enabled in your GKE cluster. [See the workload identity instructions](docs/workload-identity.md) to configure and deploy the app. Then, use the [service mesh guide](/docs/service-mesh.md).
- **non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind)**: see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md)


## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Local Development

If you would like to contribute features or fixes to this app, see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md) on how to build this demo locally.
